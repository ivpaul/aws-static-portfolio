                    Hi -â€” I'm Ivan!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a cybersecurity professional with 4 years of technical experience and 3 years of scripting/programming experience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2023, I pivoted my career interests to information technology and data science
                    after originally pursuing an academic cancer 
                    research career. I have spent the past few years developing a strong foundation in 
                    computer science, architecture, and software engineering skills. Through the rise of 
                    LLMs and AI models, I formed keen interests in AI, cloud, and data security.
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    My scientific background has trained me to approach challenges objectively 
                    and methodically. As someone still fresh to the cybersecurity industry, I am eager 
                    to keep learning and growing. My goal is to document and showcase my thoughts and interests
                    openly as I explore both the fundamentals and emerging technologies in this field.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Feel free to explore or contact me about my skills, qualifications, and projects 
                    I've built, or connect with me below!
                </p>
