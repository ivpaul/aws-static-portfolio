                <p>
                    I spent the first four years of my career in academic cancer research, where I was exposed 
                    to the fields of data analytics, informatics, and information technology. After completing 
                    postbac coursework in statistics and object-oriented programming, I pivoted my career 
                    interests away from the life sciences and began developing skills for a more technical role. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Through the rise of Generative AI and my Masters progam enrollment, I
                    continued building foundations in computer science, systems architecture, and software engineering skills. 
                    I now find myself in a cybersecurity role with the Department of Defense to support national security, where 
                    my projects relate to cloud development, analytics, public key infrastructure, and project management. 
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    My scientific background trained me to approach challenges objectively 
                    and methodically, which allows me to continuously learn new skills and expand my technical knowledge. 
                    I am actively building toward future opportunities in AI and cloud development/security.
                    My goal is to document and share my thoughts and interests
                    openly as I explore both the fundamentals and emerging technologies of AI and cloud.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Feel free to explore or contact me about my skills, qualifications, and projects 
                    I've built, or connect with me below!
