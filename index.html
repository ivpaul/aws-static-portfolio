                    I began my career in academic cancer research, where I developed a strong foundation in data analytics, informatics, and information technology. After completing postbaccalaureate coursework in statistics and object-oriented programming, I shifted my focus away from the life sciences and began building skills for a more technical career path.

                <p>
                    Through my master’s program and the rise of Generative AI, I deepened my knowledge of computer science, systems architecture, and software engineering. Today, I work in a cybersecurity role with the Department of Defense, where I support national security initiatives through projects involving cloud development, analytics, public key infrastructure, and project management.

                <p> 
                    My scientific training taught me to approach challenges methodically and objectively—skills that help me continuously learn, adapt, and expand my technical expertise. I am actively pursuing opportunities in AI, cloud development, and cloud security, and I am passionate about sharing my insights as I explore both fundamental principles and emerging technologies.

                    Feel free to explore my work, connect with me, or reach out about my skills, qualifications, and projects.
